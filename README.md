# Tango with Rango

## Introduction

This GIT repository is my active learning trail for the Django tutorial "Tango with Rango". 
As I write these lines, this is the most complete tutorial I have found on this framework. 
I wish to solidify the learning I have done so far via sites such as Pluralsight. 
Along with this, I want to be able to build a planning utility for Alexandra and myself
soon.

## Aims

1. Leverage Python virtual environment (virtualenv)
