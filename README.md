# Tango with Rango

## Introduction

This GIT repository is my active learning trail for the Django tutorial "Tango with Rango". 
As I write these lines, this is the most complete tutorial I have found on this framework. 
I wish to solidify the learning I have done so far via sites such as Pluralsight. 
Along with this, I want to be able to build a planning utility for Alexandra and myself
soon.

## Aims

1. Leverage Python virtual environment (virtualenv)
2. Improve confidence in working with Web Applications

## Assumptions

- We will use the latest version of Python and Django for this tutorial. 
This is despite the fact that the book references old versions of both.

## Live Journal

### Chapter 1.

I have read the 1st [chapter](http://www.tangowithdjango.com/book17/chapters/overview.html "Overview" ) in full.

I have installed the latest version of Python for Windows and I can find in the the path.

Using `pip`, I installed the `virtualenv` package.

__Remember__! To create an environment named *venv* use the command:

``virtualenv venv``

This will create a `venv` directory within the current directory.

To activate the enviroment, use the command ``venv\Scripts\activate``

This will change the command line prompt.
